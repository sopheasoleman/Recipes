## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions  

1. **Make the Spice Blend**  
   In a small bowl, combine **4 tsp salt, 2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, and ½ tsp cayenne**.  

2. **Prepare the Marinade**  
   Whisk eggs and water in a large bowl. Stir in the spice blend until smooth.  

3. **Marinate the Chicken**  
   Submerge chicken pieces in the egg mixture. Cover and refrigerate for **12–24 hours** for maximum flavor.  

4. **Coat the Chicken**  
   Dredge marinated chicken in a mixture of **2 cups flour and 1 tsp salt**, shaking off excess.  

5. **Heat the Oil**  
   Pour vegetable oil into a deep fryer or skillet. Heat to **350°F (180°C)** using a thermometer.  

6. **Fry to Perfection**  
   Fry chicken in batches for **12–15 minutes**, turning occasionally, until golden-brown and crispy.  

7. **Drain & Serve**  
   Place fried chicken on a wire rack to drain excess oil. Serve hot or at room temperature.

## 💡 Pro Tips  
- **Marinating Magic:** Overnight marinating ensures spices penetrate the meat fully.  
- **Oil Temperature:** Maintain **350°F (180°C)** for even cooking—too hot, and the crust burns; too cool, and the chicken becomes greasy.  
- **Crispy Secret:** Let chicken rest on a wire rack instead of paper towels to retain crunch.
