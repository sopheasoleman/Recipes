## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Aromatic Base
1. Heat ½ cup oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker over medium heat.  
2. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.  
3. Stir in the garlic, cloves, cinnamon stick, black cardamom, and bay leaf. Let them sizzle for a minute until fragrant.

### Step 2: Cook the Tomatoes
1. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften into a thick paste.  
2. Stir occasionally to avoid sticking or burning.

### Step 3: Mix in the Chickpeas and Raisins
1. Add the chickpeas and raisins to the pot.  
2. Sprinkle in garam masala, cumin seeds, and salt. Stir everything well so that the chickpeas absorb all the flavors.

### Step 4: Add the Rice and Cook
1. Drain the soaked basmati rice and add it to the pot.  
2. Pour in the vegetable stock or water, ensuring the liquid covers the rice completely.  
3. Stir gently to mix everything together.

### Step 5: Cook to Perfection
- **Pressure Cooker**: Cook on medium heat for one whistle.  
- **Regular Pot**: Cover with a lid and let it simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid is fully absorbed.

### Step 6: Rest and Serve
1. Let the pulao sit for 5 minutes before fluffing it with a fork.  
2. Serve hot with yogurt raita, pickles, or a side salad.
