## Instructions

### 1: Prepare the Maple & Pecan Filling
1. In a small saucepan, combine maple syrup, brown sugar, heavy cream, and egg yolk.
2. Heat over medium-low, stirring frequently until well combined.
3. Add the cubed butter, stirring until melted.
4. Bring to a light boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped pecans.
6. Let the filling cool at room temperature or refrigerate for 30 minutes to thicken.

### 2: Prepare the Puff Pastry
1. Preheat the oven to **355°F (180°C)** and place the rack in the middle position.
2. Roll out the puff pastry into two **10” x 15” (25 cm x 35 cm)** rectangles (if using pre-rolled sheets, skip this step).
3. Cut each pastry into four **5” x 7.5” (10 cm x 16 cm)** rectangles.

### 3: Fill & Shape the Plaits
1. Spoon **2–3 tablespoons** of cooled maple pecan filling in the center of each pastry, leaving **½ inch** space on the top and bottom and **2 ½ inches** on the sides.
2. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut diagonal slits along the sides of the pastry.
3. Fold the strips alternately over the filling, overlapping them to create a braided effect.
4. Tuck in the top and bottom edges to seal the plait.

### 4: Bake the Pastries
1. Transfer the pastries onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.
2. Brush the tops with egg wash and sprinkle with extra chopped pecans.
3. Bake for **18–20 minutes** until golden brown.
4. Let them cool on a wire rack before serving.
